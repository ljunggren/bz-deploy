# Agent Instructions

This directory contains operational instructions for AI agents working on the bz-deploy codebase.

## Structure

- `instructions.md` - Main index linking to all instruction files
- `instructions/` - Modular instruction files (Ansible, deployment, operations, etc.)
- `context/` - Project context and infrastructure knowledge
- `memory/` - Session progress and deployment logs

## Usage

AI agents should read `instructions.md` first to understand project conventions and deployment workflows.
